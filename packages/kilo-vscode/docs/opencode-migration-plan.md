# Feature Parity Plan — Kilo Code VS Code Extension (Rebuild)

## Overview

This extension is a **ground-up rebuild** of the [old Kilo Code extension](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode-legacy) using Kilo CLI as the backend. Rather than migrating the old extension's codebase, we started fresh with a Solid.js webview, a CLI server manager, and a message-based protocol between extension host and webview. This new extension lives in the [kilocode monorepo](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/tree/main/packages/kilo-vscode).

This document tracks remaining work needed for feature parity with the old extension. Each feature links to its detailed parity requirement doc. Features sourced from the [GitHub project board](https://github.com/orgs/Kilo-Org/projects/25/views/1) include issue links.

## Pre-Production Checklist

Before publishing this extension to the VS Code Marketplace or deploying to users, verify every item below.

### Security

- [ ] **Review and tighten CSP** — The current policy in [`KiloProvider._getHtmlForWebview()`](../src/KiloProvider.ts:829) has several areas to audit:
  - `style-src 'unsafe-inline'` is broadly permissive — investigate whether nonce-based style loading is feasible now that kilo-ui styles are bundled
  - `connect-src http://127.0.0.1:* http://localhost:*` allows connections to _any_ localhost port — tighten to the actual CLI server port once known at runtime
  - `img-src … https:` allows images from any HTTPS origin — scope to `${webview.cspSource} data:` unless external images are explicitly needed
  - `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` in `script-src` was added for shiki — confirm it is still required and document the reason
  - `ws://` connections to any localhost port — same concern as `connect-src`
- [ ] **Validate `openExternal` URLs** — The [`openExternal` handler](../src/KiloProvider.ts:186) passes any URL from the webview directly to `vscode.env.openExternal()` with no allowlist or scheme check. Restrict to `https:` (and possibly `vscode:`) schemes, or allowlist specific hosts
- [ ] **Audit credential storage** — CLI stores credentials as plaintext JSON with `chmod 0600`. Evaluate whether VS Code's `SecretStorage` API should be used for extension-side secrets, and document the threat model for CLI-managed credentials
- [ ] **Audit workspace path containment** — CLI's path traversal checks are lexical only; symlinks and Windows cross-drive paths can escape the workspace boundary. Determine if additional hardening (realpath canonicalization) is needed before production

### Reliability

- [ ] **VS Code error notifications** — Critical errors (CLI missing, server crash, connection lost) need VS Code-native notifications ([details](infrastructure/vscode-error-notifications.md)). Users get no feedback if the webview is hidden
- [ ] **HTTP request timeouts** — SDK calls need configurable timeouts ([details](infrastructure/http-request-timeouts.md))

### Testing

- [ ] **Test coverage** — Only one test file exists ([`extension.test.ts`](../src/test/extension.test.ts)). Add integration tests for: server lifecycle, SSE event routing, message send/receive, permission flow, session management
- [ ] **Multi-theme visual check** — Verify the webview renders correctly in at least one light theme, one dark theme, and one high-contrast theme
- [ ] **Multi-platform smoke test** — Test on macOS, Windows, and Linux. Particularly: CLI binary provisioning, path handling, `chmod`-based credential protection on Windows

### Packaging & Marketplace

- [ ] **Bundle size audit** — With kilo-ui and its transitive dependencies (shiki, marked, katex, dompurify, etc.) now bundled, measure `dist/webview.js` size and verify the total `.vsix` package size is acceptable
- [ ] **`.vscodeignore` review** — Ensure only necessary files are included in the package (no `docs/`, `src/`, test artifacts, or development scripts)
- [ ] **Marketplace metadata** — Verify [`README.md`](../README.md), [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md), publisher name, extension icon, and [`package.json`](../package.json) fields (`displayName`, `description`, `categories`, `keywords`, `repository`) are production-ready
- [ ] **`activationEvents` review** — Confirm the extension only activates when needed (not `*`), to avoid impacting VS Code startup time
- [ ] **Minimum VS Code version** — Verify `engines.vscode` in [`package.json`](../package.json) matches the minimum API features actually used

### Logging & Observability

- [ ] **Dedicated output channel** — All logging currently goes to `console.log` mixed with other extensions ([details](infrastructure/dedicated-output-channel.md)). Create a dedicated "Kilo Code" output channel before production
- [ ] **Remove or guard verbose logging** — Many `console.log` calls with emojis and debug detail exist in [`KiloProvider.ts`](../src/KiloProvider.ts). Gate behind a debug flag or move to the output channel at appropriate log levels

---

## Implementation Notes

### Architecture

- **Solid.js** (not React) powers the webview. JSX compiles via `esbuild-plugin-solid`. All webview components use Solid's reactive primitives (signals, createEffect, etc.).
- **Two separate esbuild builds**: extension (Node/CJS) and webview (browser/IIFE), configured in [`esbuild.js`](../esbuild.js).
- **No shared state** between extension and webview. All communication is via `vscode.Webview.postMessage()` with typed messages defined in [`messages.ts`](../webview-ui/src/types/messages.ts). Provider hierarchy: `ThemeProvider → DialogProvider → VSCodeProvider → ServerProvider → LanguageBridge → MarkedProvider → ProviderProvider → SessionProvider → DataBridge`.
- **CLI backend owns**: agent orchestration, MCP lifecycle, tool execution, search/grep/glob, session storage, permissions runtime, custom commands, skills, and fast edits.
- **Extension owns**: VS Code API integrations (code actions, inline completions, terminal, SCM, settings sync), webview rendering, auth mediation, and any feature not supported by CLI.

### kilo-ui Shared Library

- **kilo-ui shared library**: The webview now heavily uses `@kilocode/kilo-ui` for UI components. A `DataBridge` component in App.tsx adapts the session store to kilo-ui's `DataProvider` expected shape, enabling shared components like `<KiloMessage>` to work with the extension's data model.

### Key Differences from Old Extension

- No `Task.ts` or `webviewMessageHandler.ts` — the CLI server replaces the old in-process agent loop.
- Permissions flow through CLI's ask/reply model, not extension-side approval queues. Permissions are rendered through kilo-ui's DataProvider pattern, not a standalone PermissionDialog.
- Session history is CLI-managed, not stored in VS Code global state.
- MCP servers are configured and managed by the CLI, not the extension.
