// Kilo-specific replacement for the shared `@opencode-ai/ui/pierre/worker`
// module (wired up by the pierre-worker-alias plugin in esbuild.js).
//
// The upstream module loads Pierre's Shiki worker through a Vite-only
// `?worker&url` import, which esbuild cannot resolve and which the VS Code
// webview CSP blocks. As a result the webview previously ran syntax
// highlighting synchronously on the main thread (`findNextMatchSync`), which
// froze scrolling on large diffs.
//
// Here we instead load the worker from a real dist asset (`dist/shiki-worker.js`,
// also produced by esbuild.js) using the webview URI the extension injects into
// the page. Pierre can offload highlighted updates to the pool after its initial
// plain render. The diff wrapper still needs to keep that initial render cheap,
// which is why review surfaces pass hunk-bounded patches instead of full files.

// instantiate, WorkerPoolManager falls back to the main-thread highlighter. To
// avoid WebAssembly entirely, build the portable worker and use "shiki-js".
