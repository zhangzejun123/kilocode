# GitHub Code Reviews

Kilo's Code Reviews integrate with GitHub via a **GitHub App** to automatically review pull requests with AI. When a PR is opened, updated, or marked ready for review, the Review Agent analyzes the changes and posts feedback directly on the pull request.

## Prerequisites

- A Kilo Code account at [app.kilo.ai](https://app.kilo.ai)
- A GitHub account with access to the repositories you want to review
- Kilo Code credits for AI model usage

## Setup

### Step 1: Install the GitHub App

Connect your GitHub account via the [Integrations page](/docs/automate/integrations#connecting-github). Once connected, return here to configure the Review Agent.

The GitHub App requests the following permissions:

| Permission | Access | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Pull requests | Read & Write | Post review comments |
| Repository contents | Read | Analyze code |
| Issues | Read & Write | Post summary comments, reactions |
| Metadata | Read | List repositories |

### Step 2: Configure the Review Agent

1. Go to **Code Reviews**:
   - **Personal**: [app.kilo.ai/code-reviews](https://app.kilo.ai/code-reviews)
   - **Organization**: Your organization → Code Reviews
2. Toggle **Enable AI Code Review** to on
3. Configure your preferences:
   - **AI Model** — Select from available models (default: Claude Sonnet 4.5)
   - **Review Style** — Strict, Balanced, or Lenient
   - **Repository Selection** — All repositories or select specific ones
   - **Focus Areas** — Security, performance, bugs, style, testing, documentation
   - **Max Review Time** — 5 to 30 minutes
   - **Custom Instructions** — Add team-specific review guidelines
4. Click **Save Configuration**

### Step 3: Open a Pull Request

Once configured, the Review Agent automatically runs when:

| PR Event | Triggers Review |
|---|---|
| PR opened | ✅ Yes |
| New commits pushed to PR | ✅ Yes |
| PR reopened | ✅ Yes |
| Draft PR marked ready | ✅ Yes |
| Draft PR opened | ❌ Skipped |
| PR closed | ❌ No |

## What to Expect

When a review triggers:

1. A 👀 reaction appears on the PR — this means Kilo is reviewing
2. The AI model analyzes the diff and changed files
3. The agent posts:
   - A **summary comment** with overall findings
   - **Inline comments** on specific lines with issues and suggestions
   - Severity tags (critical, warning, info)

### When You Push New Commits

- The previous review is **automatically cancelled** (no stale feedback)
- A new review starts for the latest commit
- If a previous summary comment exists, it is **updated in place**

## Repository Selection

- **All repositories** — Every repo accessible to the GitHub App triggers reviews
- **Selected repositories** — Only repos you choose in the configuration

The repository list is synced from GitHub and can be refreshed from the configuration page.

## Troubleshooting

### Reviews are not triggering

1. Verify the GitHub App is installed and has access to the repository
2. Check that the Review Agent is **enabled** in the Code Reviews configuration
3. Ensure the repository is in the allowed list (if using "Selected repositories" mode)
4. Confirm the PR is not a draft

### Reviews are failing

- Check the Code Reviews page for error details on specific reviews
- Ensure you have sufficient Kilo Code credits
- Very large PRs may time out — try increasing the max review time

### The GitHub App is missing permissions

1. Go to your GitHub Settings → Applications → KiloConnect → Configure
2. Verify the app has the required permissions listed above
3. If permissions were changed, you may need to re-authorize

### Duplicate comments

The system automatically deduplicates reviews for the same PR and commit SHA. If you see duplicate comments, this may be from a previous version — push a new commit to trigger a fresh review.
