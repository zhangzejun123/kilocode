Connect your KiloClaw agent to Slack by creating a Slack app from the OpenClaw manifest and linking it to your KiloClaw dashboard.

## Step 1: Create a Slack App from the OpenClaw Manifest

1. Go to [Slack App Management](https://api.slack.com/apps) and click **Create New App** → **From a Manifest**
2. Copy the manifest from the [OpenClaw docs](https://docs.openclaw.ai/channels/slack#manifest-and-scope-checklist)
3. Paste the manifest JSON into Slack's manifest editor
4. Customize the manifest before creating:
   - Rename the app to your preferred name wherever it appears
   - Update the slash command if desired (e.g., `/kiloclaw`)
5. Click **Create**

## Step 2: Generate Tokens

You need two tokens from Slack:

**App-Level Token**

1. In your Slack app settings, scroll down to **App-Level Tokens**
2. Click **Generate Token**
3. Add the `connections:write` scope
4. Generate and copy the token (starts with `xapp-`)

**Bot User OAuth Token**

1. In the left sidebar, click **Install App**
2. Install the app to your workspace
3. Copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** (starts with `xoxb-`)

## Step 3: Connect Slack to KiloClaw

1. In the [KiloClaw UI](https://app.kilo.ai/claw), find the Slack integration section (may show "not configured")
2. Enter both tokens:
   - The `xapp-` app-level token
   - The `xoxb-` bot user OAuth token
3. Click **Save**
4. Scroll to the top of the KiloClaw UI and click **Redeploy**. Wait for the instance to come back up

## Step 4: Pair Slack with KiloClaw

1. In Slack, DM the app and send any message — this triggers the pairing flow

2. The app will return a pairing code
3. Return to [app.kilocode.ai/claw](https://app.kilocode.ai/claw) and confirm the pairing code and approve
4. You should now be able to DM the bot from Slack. You will need to add the bot to any individual channels and tell it to update its config for any channels you want it to participate in.
