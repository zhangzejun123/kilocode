# Using Fireworks AI With Kilo Code

Fireworks AI is a high-performance platform for running AI models that offers fast access to a wide range of open-source and proprietary language models. Built for speed and reliability, Fireworks AI provides both serverless and dedicated deployment options with OpenAI-compatible APIs.

**Website:** [https://fireworks.ai/](https://fireworks.ai/)

## Getting an API Key

1. **Sign Up/Sign In:** Go to [Fireworks AI](https://fireworks.ai/) and create an account or sign in.
2. **Navigate to API Keys:** After logging in, go to the [API Keys page](https://app.fireworks.ai/settings/users/api-keys) in the account settings.
3. **Create a Key:** Click "Create API key" and give your key a descriptive name (e.g., "Kilo Code").
4. **Copy the Key:** Copy the API key _immediately_ and store it securely. You will not be able to see it again.

## Configuration in Kilo Code

{% tabs %}
{% tab label="VSCode (Legacy)" %}

1. **Open Kilo Code Settings:** Click the gear icon ({% codicon name="gear" /%}) in the Kilo Code panel.
2. **Select Provider:** Choose "Fireworks AI" from the "API Provider" dropdown.
3. **Enter API Key:** Paste your Fireworks AI API key into the "Fireworks AI API Key" field.
4. **Select Model:** Choose your desired model from the "Model" dropdown.

{% /tab %}
{% tab label="VSCode" %}

Open **Settings** (gear icon) and go to the **Providers** tab to add Fireworks AI and enter your API key.

The extension stores this in your `kilo.json` config file. You can also edit the config file directly — see the **CLI** tab for the file format.

{% /tab %}
{% tab label="CLI" %}

Set the API key as an environment variable or configure it in your `kilo.json` config file:

**Environment variable:**

```bash
export FIREWORKS_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

**Config file** (`~/.config/kilo/kilo.json` or `./kilo.json`):

```jsonc
{
  "provider": {
    "fireworks-ai": {
      "env": ["FIREWORKS_API_KEY"],
    },
  },
}
```

Then set your default model:

```jsonc
{
  "model": "fireworks-ai/accounts/fireworks/models/llama4-scout-instruct-basic",
}
```

{% /tab %}
{% /tabs %}
