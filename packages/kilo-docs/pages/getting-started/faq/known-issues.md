# Known Issues

This section contains known issues and limitations of Kilo Code.

## VSCode

### Workflows get stuck on "API Request…" and never start

#### Symptoms

- Workflow shows "API Request…" and keeps spinning
- Usage meter stays at 0 tokens
- Canceling shows "Task file not found for task ID"
- VS Code becomes unresponsive until restart

#### Cause

In some cases, this behavior can be caused by a conflict with other VS Code extensions that interact with files or workspace scanning.

A reported example was the **Todo Tree** extension, which interfered with workflow execution. Disabling the extension resolved the issue immediately.

#### Workarounds

1. Temporarily disable recently installed VS Code extensions
2. Retry the workflow
3. Re-enable extensions one by one to identify conflicts

#### Recommendation

If you encounter similar behavior:

- Test with extensions disabled
- [Share logs](/docs/getting-started/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-extension) with support if the issue persists

We are working on documenting known extension conflicts to improve troubleshooting guidance.

### Why am I seeing a "PowerShell not recognized" error on Windows?

You may see an error like this:

```
Command failed with exit code 1: powershell (Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_OperatingSystem).caption
'powershell' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```

This error occurs when Windows cannot find the PowerShell executable. Most commonly, this happens because the `PATH` environment variable does not include the directory where PowerShell is installed.

#### How do I fix this?

**Add PowerShell to your PATH:**

1. Press `Windows + X` (or right-click the Start button) and select **System**
2. Click **Advanced system settings**
3. Select **Environment Variables**
4. Under **System variables** (or User variables), find **Path** and click **Edit**
5. Click **New** and add:
   ```
   %SYSTEMROOT%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\
   ```
6. Click **OK** to save your changes
7. Restart your computer

#### Do I need to restart?

Yes. A restart is required for Windows to apply the updated `PATH` variable.

#### Why does this error appear in remote or container environments?

This error can also appear if a Windows-specific PowerShell command is executed in:

- Remote SSH sessions
- Containers
- WSL
- macOS or Linux environments

In these cases, PowerShell may not be available, and the command must be replaced with an OS-appropriate alternative.

#### Still having issues?

Verify that PowerShell is installed and accessible by running:

### Kilo Code not visible (JCEF errors)

#### Symptoms

- Kilo Code panel doesn't render or appears blank
- Errors such as `JCEF is not supported in this environment or failed to initialize`
- `Internal JCEF not supported, trying external JCEF`

#### Cause

Kilo Code depends on **JCEF (JetBrains Chromium Embedded Framework)** to display its interface. If the bundled Java runtime doesn't include JCEF, or JCEF is disabled, the panel cannot render.

#### Resolution

1. Go to **Help → Find Action → Choose Boot Java Runtime**
2. Select a runtime that includes **JCEF**
3. If JCEF is already bundled, confirm it's enabled:
   Open **Help → Edit Custom Properties** and add:
   ```
   ide.browser.jcef.enabled=true
   ```
4. Restart your IDE

### TLS / Certificate errors

#### Symptoms

- `Failed to fetch extension base URL`
- `PKIX path building failed`
- `unable to find valid certification path to requested target`

#### Cause

The IDE cannot validate the TLS certificate used by the Kilo Code endpoint or a network proxy. Common causes include untrusted root certificates, corporate proxies intercepting HTTPS traffic, or missing intermediate certificates.

#### Resolution

- Install the **root certificate** in your OS trust store
- Ensure the **complete certificate chain** is presented by the server
- If managed internally, contact your IT/admin team

JetBrains IDEs rely on the **system certificate store**, so resolving trust at the OS level usually fixes the issue.

{% callout type="note" %}
**JetBrains 2024.3 note:** Some builds may fail to recognize OS certificates. Workarounds include downgrading to a previous version, upgrading to **2024.3.1 or later**, or adding the JVM option `-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStoreType=Windows-ROOT`.

### Android Studio

#### Custom workspace required

##### Symptoms

- `Kilo Code cannot access paths without an active workspace`

##### Cause

Kilo Code requires an explicit workspace configuration to access project files in JetBrains IDEs. This is especially common in Android Studio, which may not automatically set up the workspace that Kilo Code expects.

##### Resolution

1. Open **Settings / Preferences**
2. Navigate to **Tools → Kilo Code**
3. Locate **Custom Workspaces**
4. Click **Add Workspace**
5. Select your project folder
6. Apply changes and restart the IDE
