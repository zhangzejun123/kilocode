# Kilo Connect

**Kilo Connect** brings Kilo Code into the tools your team already uses. Instead of switching to a separate interface, you can trigger implementations, ask questions, and get pull requests opened from your chat, issue tracker, or code review workflow. You can also connect DoltHub as a data source for Dolt-versioned data.

## How to Set Up

All integrations are configured from the **Integrations** tab at [app.kilo.ai](https://app.kilo.ai). Each integration requires:

- A Kilo Code account with available credits
- The specific integration installed and authorized for your workspace
- A connected Git provider (GitHub or GitLab) for repository workflows such as Cloud Agents, Code Reviews, and Kilo Deploy
