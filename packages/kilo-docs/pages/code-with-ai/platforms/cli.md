# Kilo CLI

Orchestrate agents from your terminal. Plan, debug, and code fast with keyboard-first navigation on the command line.

The Kilo Code CLI uses the same underlying technology that powers the IDE extensions, so you can expect the same workflow to handle agentic coding tasks from start to finish.

## Getting Started

### Install

{% partial file="install-cli.md" /%}

Change directory to where you want to work and run kilo:

```bash
# Start the TUI
kilo

# Check the version
kilo --version

# Get help
kilo --help
```

### First-Time Setup with `/connect`

After installation, run `kilo` and use the `/connect` command to add your first provider credentials. This is the interactive way to configure API keys for model providers.

## Update

Upgrade the Kilo CLI:

`kilo upgrade`

Or use npm:

`npm update -g @kilocode/cli`

## What you can do with Kilo Code CLI

- **Plan and execute code changes without leaving your terminal.** Use your command line to make edits to your project without opening your IDE.
- **Switch between hundreds of LLMs without constraints.** Other CLI tools only work with one model or curate opinionated lists. With Kilo, you can switch models without booting up another tool.
- **Choose the right mode for the task in your workflow.** Select between Architect, Ask, Debug, Orchestrator, or custom agent modes.
- **Automate tasks.** Get AI assistance writing shell scripts for tasks like renaming all of the files in a folder or transforming sizes for a set of images.
- **Extend capabilities with skills.** Add domain expertise and repeatable workflows through [Agent Skills](#skills).

## Config Reference

Configuration is managed through:

- `/connect` command for provider setup (interactive)
- Config files in **`~/.config/kilo/`**: use **`kilo.jsonc`** for provider, model, permission, and **MCP** settings. Restart the CLI after editing. See [Using MCP in Kilo Code](/docs/automate/mcp/using-in-kilo-code) for MCP config format.
- `kilo auth` for credential management

## Slash Commands

The CLI's interactive mode supports slash commands for common operations. The main commands are documented above in the [Interactive Slash Commands](#interactive-slash-commands) section.

{% /callout %}

## Permissions

Kilo Code uses the permission config to decide whether a given action should run automatically, prompt you, or be blocked.

### Actions

Each permission rule resolves to one of:

- `"allow"` — run without approval
- `"ask"` — prompt for approval
- `"deny"` — block the action

### Configuration

You can set permissions globally (with `*`), and override specific tools.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://app.kilo.ai/config.json",
  "permission": {
    "*": "ask",
    "bash": "allow",
    "edit": "deny"
  }
}
```

You can also set all permissions at once:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://app.kilo.ai/config.json",
  "permission": "allow"
}
```

### Granular Rules (Object Syntax)

For most permissions, you can use an object to apply different actions based on the tool input.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://app.kilo.ai/config.json",
  "permission": {
    "bash": {
      "*": "ask",
      "git *": "allow",
      "npm *": "allow",
      "rm *": "deny",
      "grep *": "allow"
    },
    "edit": {
      "*": "deny",
      "packages/web/src/content/docs/*.mdx": "allow"
    }
  }
}
```

Rules are evaluated by pattern match, with the last matching rule winning. A common pattern is to put the catch-all `"*"` rule first, and more specific rules after it.

### Wildcards

Permission patterns use simple wildcard matching:

- `*` matches zero or more of any character
- `?` matches exactly one character
- All other characters match literally

### Home Directory Expansion

You can use `~` or `$HOME` at the start of a pattern to reference your home directory. This is particularly useful for `external_directory` rules.

- `~/projects/*` → `/Users/username/projects/*`
- `$HOME/projects/*` → `/Users/username/projects/*`
- `~` → `/Users/username`

### External Directories

Use `external_directory` to allow tool calls that touch paths outside the working directory where Kilo was started. This applies to any tool that takes a path as input (for example `read`, `edit`, `list`, `glob`, `grep`, and many bash commands).

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://app.kilo.ai/config.json",
  "permission": {
    "external_directory": {
      "~/projects/personal/**": "allow"
    }
  }
}
```

Any directory allowed here inherits the same defaults as the current workspace. Since `read` defaults to `"allow"`, reads are also allowed for entries under `external_directory` unless overridden. Add explicit rules when a tool should be restricted in these paths, such as blocking edits while keeping reads:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://app.kilo.ai/config.json",
  "permission": {
    "external_directory": {
      "~/projects/personal/**": "allow"
    },
    "edit": {
      "~/projects/personal/**": "deny"
    }
  }
}
```

**Aliases:** `/t` and `/history` can be used as shorthand for `/tasks`

## Configuration

The Kilo CLI is a fork of [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) and supports the same configuration options. The CLI you install with `npm install -g @kilocode/cli` (Kilo CLI 1.0) is built from [Kilo-Org/kilocode](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode). For comprehensive configuration documentation, see the [OpenCode Config documentation](https://opencode.ai/docs/config).

### Config File Location (Kilo CLI 1.0)

| Scope       | Path                                                                                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Global**  | `~/.config/kilo/opencode.json` or `opencode.jsonc` (Windows: config dir may vary; same filenames) |
| **Project** | `./opencode.json` or `./.opencode/` in project root                                               |

Project-level configuration takes precedence over global settings.

### Key Configuration Options

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://app.kilo.ai/config.json",
  "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
  "provider": {
    "anthropic": {
      "options": {
        "apiKey": "{env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Common configuration options include:

- **`model`** - Default model in `provider_id/model_id` format (e.g., `"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514"`)
- **`provider`** - Provider-specific settings (API keys, base URLs, [custom models](/docs/code-with-ai/agents/custom-models))
- **`mcp`** - MCP server configuration
- **`permission`** - Tool permission settings (`allow` or `ask`)
- **`instructions`** - Paths to instruction files (e.g., `["CONTRIBUTING.md", ".cursor/rules/*.md"]`)
- **`formatter`** - Code formatter configuration
- **`disabled_providers`** / **`enabled_providers`** - Control which providers are available

{% callout type="tip" %}
**Using a model that's not in the built-in list?** You can register any model by adding it under `provider.<provider_id>.models` in your config file. See [Custom Models](/docs/code-with-ai/agents/custom-models) for full details and examples.
{% /callout %}

### Environment Variables

Use `{env:VARIABLE_NAME}` syntax in config files to reference environment variables:

```json
{
  "provider": {
    "openai": {
      "options": {
        "apiKey": "{env:OPENAI_API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For full details on all configuration options including compaction, file watchers, plugins, and experimental features, see the [OpenCode Config documentation](https://opencode.ai/docs/config).

## Interactive Mode

Interactive mode is the default mode when running Kilo Code without the `--auto` flag, designed to work interactively with a user through the console.

In interactive mode Kilo Code will request approval for operations which have not been auto-approved, allowing the user to review and approve operations before they are executed, and optionally add them to the auto-approval list.

### Interactive Command Approval

When running in interactive mode, command approval requests show hierarchical options:

```
[!] Action Required:
> ✓ Run Command (y)
  ✓ Always run git (1)
  ✓ Always run git status (2)
  ✓ Always run git status --short --branch (3)
  ✗ Reject (n)
```

Selecting an "Always run" option will:

1. Approve and execute the current command
2. Add the pattern to your `execute.allowed` list in the config
3. Auto-approve matching commands in the future

This allows you to progressively build your auto-approval rules without manually editing the config file.

## Autonomous Mode (Non-Interactive)

Autonomous mode allows Kilo Code to run in automated environments like CI/CD pipelines without requiring user interaction.

```bash
# Run in autonomous mode with a message
kilo run --auto "Implement feature X"
```

### Autonomous Mode Behavior

When running in autonomous mode:

1. **No User Interaction**: All approval requests are handled automatically based on configuration
2. **Auto-Approval/Rejection**: Operations are approved or rejected based on your auto-approval settings
3. **Follow-up Questions**: Automatically responded with a message instructing the AI to make autonomous decisions
4. **Automatic Exit**: The CLI exits automatically when the task completes or times out

### Auto-Approval in Autonomous Mode

Autonomous mode respects your [auto-approval configuration](#auto-approval-settings). Operations which are not auto-approved will not be allowed.

### Autonomous Mode Follow-up Questions

In autonomous mode, when the AI asks a follow-up question, it receives this response:

> "This process is running in non-interactive autonomous mode. The user cannot make decisions, so you should make the decision autonomously."

This instructs the AI to proceed without user input.

### Exit Codes

- `0`: Success (task completed)
- `124`: Timeout (task exceeded time limit)
- `1`: Error (initialization or execution failure)

### Example CI/CD Integration

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Run Kilo Code
  run: |
    kilo run "Implement the new feature" --auto
```

## Session Continuation

Resume your last conversation from the current workspace using the `--continue` (or `-c`) flag:

```bash
# Resume the most recent session from this workspace
kilo --continue
kilo -c
```

This feature:

- Automatically finds the most recent session from the current workspace
- Loads the full conversation history
- Allows you to continue where you left off
- Cannot be used with autonomous mode or with a prompt argument
- Exits with an error if no previous sessions are found

**Example workflow:**

```bash
# Start a session
kilo
# > "Create a REST API"
# ... work on the task ...
# Exit with /exit

# Later, resume the same session
kilo --continue
# Conversation history is restored, ready to continue
```

**Limitations:**

- Cannot be combined with autonomous mode
- Cannot be used with a prompt argument
- Only works when there's at least one previous session in the workspace

## Remote Connections

Remote Connections let you access your local CLI sessions from the Cloud Agents web interface. Requires [Kilo Gateway](/docs/gateway) connection.

### Enabling Remote Mode

**Toggle during a session:**

```
/remote
```

Requires connection to Kilo Gateway. The `/remote` command appears only when authenticated.

**Enable by default:**

Add to `~/.config/kilo/config.json`:

```json
{
  "remote_control": true
}
```

### Using Remote Mode

Once enabled, start a CLI session and open [Cloud Agents](https://app.kilo.ai/cloud). Your local session appears in the dashboard. See [Cloud Agent Remote Connections](/docs/code-with-ai/platforms/cloud-agent#remote-connections) for details.

### Requirements

- Connection to Kilo Gateway
- Same Kilo account on CLI and Cloud Agent
- CLI must remain running with internet connection

{% callout type="warning" title="Security Warning" %}
Anyone with access to your Kilo account can send messages to your computer when remote mode is enabled.
{% /callout %}

## Environment Variable Overrides

The CLI supports overriding config values with environment variables. The supported environment variables are:

- `KILO_PROVIDER`: Override the active provider ID
- For `kilocode` provider: `KILOCODE_<FIELD_NAME>` (e.g., `KILOCODE_MODEL` → `kilocodeModel`)
- For other providers: `KILO_<FIELD_NAME>` (e.g., `KILO_API_KEY` → `apiKey`)

## Using the CLI in an Organization

If you belong to a Kilo organization (Team or Enterprise), you can route CLI requests through that organization. The process differs slightly between interactive and non-interactive usage.

### Interactive Usage

In an interactive CLI session, use the `/teams` command to select an organization from your membership list.

Your selection is persisted locally so it carries over to future sessions.

### Non-Interactive Usage (`kilo run`)

There is no `--org` or `--team` flag on `kilo run`. Instead, the organization is determined from the following sources, in order of priority (highest first):

1. **`KILO_ORG_ID` environment variable** — Best for non-interactive and CI environments.

2. **`Persisted selection from the last `/teams` pick`** — If you've run an interactive session and selected an organization via `/teams`, that selection is stored in the CLI auth file and reused automatically.
