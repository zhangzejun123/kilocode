# Kilo for Slack

**Kilo for Slack** brings Kilo Code directly into your Slack workspace. Ask questions about your repositories, request code implementations, debug issues, and collaborate with your team — all without leaving Slack.

When you mention `@Kilo` in a thread, the bot:

- Reads the full conversation
- Accesses your connected repositories
- Answers your question or spins up a Cloud Agent to implement the change
- Creates branches, pushes commits, and opens pull requests on your behalf

---

## What You Can Do

### Ask questions about your codebase

```
@Kilo what does the UserService class do in our main backend repo?
```

```
@Kilo how is error handling implemented in the payment processing module?
```

### Implement fixes and features from Slack discussions

When your team identifies a bug or improvement in a thread, ask the bot to handle it:

```
@Kilo based on this thread, can you implement the fix for the null pointer exception in the order processing service?
```

The bot will:

- Read the thread context
- Understand the proposed solution
- Create a branch with the implementation
- Push a pull request to your repository

### Implement changes across multiple repositories

If the same change needs to land in several repos, just tell the bot:

```
@Kilo please fix this in the cloud, landing, and handbook repos
```

### Debug issues

Paste an error message or stack trace and ask for help:

```
@Kilo I'm seeing this error in production:
[paste error message]
Can you help me understand what's causing it?
```

## How to Interact

### Direct Messages

You can DM Kilo directly for private conversations. Find Kilo in your workspace's app list and start a direct message.

Good for:

- Private questions about your code
- Sensitive debugging sessions
- Personal productivity tasks

### Channel Mentions

Mention the bot in any channel where it's been added:

```
@Kilo can you explain how the authentication flow works in our backend?
```

Good for:

- Team discussions where AI assistance would help
- Collaborative debugging
- Getting quick answers during code reviews

## Prerequisites

Before using Kilo for Slack:

- You need a Kilo Code account with available credits
- Your Git provider integration (GitHub or GitLab) must be configured via the Integrations tab at [app.kilo.ai](https://app.kilo.ai) so Kilo can access your repositories

---

## Setup

To install Kilo for Slack, go to the Integrations menu in the sidebar at [app.kilo.ai](https://app.kilo.ai) and set up the Slack integration.

| Platform | Integration Type | Details |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub | GitHub App | [GitHub Setup Guide](/docs/automate/integrations#connecting-github) |
| GitLab | OAuth or PAT | [GitLab Setup Guide](/docs/automate/integrations#connecting-gitlab) |

---

## How It Works

1. **Message Kilo** through a DM or channel mention
2. **Kilo processes your request** using your connected repositories for context
3. **AI generates a response** analyzing your request and providing an answer
4. **Code changes (if requested)** — Kilo creates a branch, commits the changes, and opens a pull or merge request

---

## Changing the Model

You can customize which AI model Kilo uses for generating responses.

1. Go to your Kilo Workspace at [app.kilo.ai](https://app.kilo.ai)
2. Navigate to **Integrations > Slack**
3. Select your preferred model

Kilo for Slack supports 400+ models across different providers. The new model applies immediately to subsequent requests.

---

## Cost

Kilo Code credits are used when Kilo performs work (model usage, operations, etc.). Credit usage is the same as using Kilo through any other interface.

---

## Tips for Best Results

- **Be specific.** The more context you provide, the better the response.
- **Reference specific files or functions.** Help the bot understand exactly what you're asking about.
- **Use threads.** Keep related conversations in threads for better context.
- **Specify the repository.** If you have multiple repos connected, mention which one you're asking about.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Kilo isn't responding.**
Make sure Kilo for Slack is installed in your workspace and has been added to the channel you're using.

**Kilo can't access my repository.**
Verify your Git provider integration is configured correctly in the Integrations tab.

**I'm getting incomplete responses.**
Try breaking your request into smaller, more specific questions.

**Kilo doesn't understand my codebase.**
Confirm that the repository you're asking about is connected and accessible through your Git provider integration.
