# Kilo for GitHub

**Kilo for GitHub** lets you interact with Kilo directly from your GitHub issues, pull requests, and review comments. Mention the bot and it will:

- Read the surrounding context
- Access the repository
- Respond with answers, code reviews, or full implementations

---

## What You Can Do

### Ask questions on review comments

When you're reviewing a pull request and want a second opinion on a piece of code:

```
@kilocode-bot is this true?
```

The bot reads the review comment, the surrounding diff, and the relevant code in the repository to give you an informed answer.

### Fix issues directly from GitHub

Tag the bot on any issue and ask it to handle the fix:

```
@kilocode-bot please fix
```

The bot will:

- Read the issue description
- Analyze the relevant code
- Create a branch with the implementation
- Open a pull request

### Diagnose bug reports

When a bug report comes in and you want to understand what's going on before diving in:

```
@kilocode-bot what could be the cause of this issue?
```

The bot examines the bug report, searches the codebase for related code paths, and shares its analysis directly in the issue thread.

## How It Works

1. **Mention `@kilocode-bot`** on an issue, pull request, or review comment
2. **Kilo reads the context** — the issue description, PR diff, review thread, and connected repository code
3. **A Cloud Agent spins up** to process the request
4. **Kilo responds** with an answer, analysis, or a pull request containing the implementation

For implementation requests, the bot creates a new branch, commits the changes, and opens a PR back to the repository. You'll see the PR linked directly in the thread.

---

## Prerequisites

- A Kilo Code account with available credits
- Your GitHub integration configured via the Integrations tab at [app.kilo.ai](https://app.kilo.ai)
- The Kilo Code Bot GitHub App installed on the relevant repositories

---

## Setup

1. Go to [app.kilo.ai](https://app.kilo.ai) and navigate to the **Integrations** tab
2. Connect your GitHub account through the **KiloConnect** GitHub App if you haven't already
3. Install the **Kilo Code Bot** GitHub App on your repositories at [github.com/apps/kilo-code-bot](https://github.com/apps/kilo-code-bot/)

Once installed, `@kilocode-bot` is available on any issue or PR in the repositories you've authorized.

---

## Use Cases

### Code Review Assistance

During a PR review, mention the bot on any comment or line of code to get a quick analysis. The bot can:

- Verify logic
- Suggest improvements
- Explain unfamiliar patterns

### Issue Triage and Fixes

When new issues come in, the bot can diagnose probable causes and, if you ask, implement a fix directly. This works best for straightforward bugs where the issue description gives enough context to act.

### Bulk or Cross-Repo Changes

Need to bump a dependency or apply a config change across your org? Mention the repos in a single comment and the bot handles each one.

---

## Cost

Kilo Code credits are consumed the same way as any other Kilo interface. Credit usage depends on the model selected and the complexity of the task.

---

## Tips for Best Results

- **Be specific about what you want.** "Please fix" works best on well-described issues. For vague issues, ask the bot to diagnose first.
- **Mention specific repositories** if the fix spans multiple repos.
- **Use on review comments** for quick, contextual questions during code review.

---

## Troubleshooting

**The bot isn't responding to mentions.**
Make sure the Kilo Code Bot GitHub App is installed on the repository and that you're mentioning `@kilocode-bot` (not `@kilo`).

**The bot can't access the repository.**
Verify that both the KiloConnect App and the Kilo Code Bot App are installed and have access to the repository in question.

**The implementation doesn't match what I expected.**
Try providing more context in the issue description or comment. The bot works best when the problem and desired outcome are clearly described.
