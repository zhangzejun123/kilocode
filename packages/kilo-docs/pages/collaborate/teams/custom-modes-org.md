# Custom Modes (Org)

Custom Modes let you create tailored versions of Kilo's built-in [agents](/docs/code-with-ai/agents/using-agents) for your organization. You can also adjust the settings for Kilo Code's original default modes. You can define a mode's purpose, behavior, and tool access — helping Kilo adapt to your team's unique workflows.

For example, Admins and Owners can extend these by creating **Custom Modes** with specialized roles or personalities (e.g. "Documentation Writer" or "Security Reviewer").

2. Click **Create New Mode**.

4. Fill in the following fields:

| Field | Description |

| **Mode Name** | Display name for the new mode (e.g. _Security Reviewer_). |
| **Mode Slug** | A short identifier used internally (e.g. `security-reviewer`). |
| **Role Definition** | Describe Kilo's role and personality for this mode. Shapes how it reasons and responds. |
| **Short Description** | A brief summary shown in the mode selector. |
| **When to Use (optional)** | Guidance for when this mode should be used. Helps the Orchestrator choose the right mode for a task. |
| **Custom Instructions (optional)** | Add behavioral guidelines specific to this mode. |
