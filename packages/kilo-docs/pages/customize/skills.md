# Skills

Kilo Code implements [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/home), a lightweight, open format for extending AI agent capabilities with specialized knowledge and workflows.

## What Are Agent Skills?

Agent Skills package domain expertise, new capabilities, and repeatable workflows that agents can use. At its core, a skill is a folder containing a `SKILL.md` file with metadata and instructions that tell an agent how to perform a specific task.

This approach keeps agents fast while giving them access to more context on demand. When a task matches a skill's description, the agent reads the full instructions into context and follows them—optionally loading referenced files or executing bundled code as needed.

### Key Benefits

- **Self-documenting**: A skill author or user can read a `SKILL.md` file and understand what it does, making skills easy to audit and improve
- **Interoperable**: Skills work across any agent that implements the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification)
- **Extensible**: Skills can range in complexity from simple text instructions to bundled scripts, templates, and reference materials
- **Shareable**: Skills are portable and can be easily shared between projects and developers

## How Skills Work in Kilo Code

Skills can be:

- **Generic** - Available in all modes
- **Mode-specific** - Only loaded when using a particular mode (e.g., `code`, `architect`)

The workflow is:

1. **Discovery**: Skills are scanned from designated directories when Kilo Code initializes. Only the metadata (name, description, and file path) is read at this stage—not the full instructions.
2. **Prompt inclusion**: When a mode is active, the metadata for relevant skills is included in the system prompt. The agent sees a list of available skills with their descriptions.
3. **On-demand loading**: When the agent determines that a task matches a skill's description, it reads the full `SKILL.md` file into context and follows the instructions.

### How the Agent Decides to Use a Skill

The agent (LLM) decides whether to use a skill based on the skill's `description` field. There's no keyword matching or semantic search—the agent evaluates your request against all available skill descriptions and determines if one "clearly and unambiguously applies."

This means:

- **Description wording matters**: Write descriptions that match how users phrase requests
- **Explicit invocation always works**: Saying "use the api-design skill" will trigger it since the agent sees the skill name
- **Vague descriptions lead to uncertain matching**: Be specific about when the skill should be used

## Skill Locations

Skills are loaded from multiple locations, allowing both personal skills and project-specific instructions.

{% tabs %}
{% tab label="VSCode" %}

### Global Skills (User-Level)

Global skills are located in the `.kilo` directory within your Home directory:

- Mac and Linux: `~/.kilo/skills/`
- Windows: `\Users\<yourUser>\.kilo\skills\`

```
~/.kilo/
└── skills/                    # Generic skills (all modes)
    ├── my-skill/
    │   └── SKILL.md
    └── another-skill/
        └── SKILL.md
```

### Project Skills (Workspace-Level)

Located in `.kilo/skills/` within your project:

```
your-project/
└── .kilo/
    └── skills/               # Generic skills for this project
        └── project-conventions/
            └── SKILL.md
```

### Compatibility Directories

For interoperability with other tools, the CLI also loads skills from:

- `.claude/skills/` — Claude Code compatibility
- `.agents/skills/` — Open agent standard

### Additional Skill Paths and Remote URLs

You can configure extra skill locations and remote skill URLs in your `kilo.jsonc` config (project or global):

```jsonc
{
  "skills": {
    "paths": ["/path/to/shared/skills", "~/my-skills", "relative/skills"],
    "urls": ["https://example.com/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md"],
  },
}
```

The `skills.paths` key accepts absolute paths, `~/` home-relative paths, or paths relative to the project root. The `skills.urls` key accepts URLs pointing to remote `SKILL.md` files that are fetched on demand.

{% /tab %}
{% tab label="CLI" %}

### Global Skills (User-Level)

Global skills are located in the `.kilo` directory within your Home directory:

- Mac and Linux: `~/.kilo/skills/`
- Windows: `\Users\<yourUser>\.kilo\skills\`

```
~/.kilo/
└── skills/                    # Generic skills (all modes)
    ├── my-skill/
    │   └── SKILL.md
    └── another-skill/
        └── SKILL.md
```

### Project Skills (Workspace-Level)

Located in `.kilo/skills/` within your project:

```
your-project/
└── .kilo/
    └── skills/               # Generic skills for this project
        └── project-conventions/
            └── SKILL.md
```

### Compatibility Directories

For interoperability with other tools, the CLI also loads skills from:

- `.claude/skills/` — Claude Code compatibility
- `.agents/skills/` — Open agent standard

### Additional Skill Paths and Remote URLs

You can configure extra skill locations and remote skill URLs in your `kilo.jsonc` config (project or global):

```jsonc
{
  "skills": {
    "paths": ["/path/to/shared/skills", "~/my-skills", "relative/skills"],
    "urls": ["https://example.com/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md"],
  },
}
```

The `skills.paths` key accepts absolute paths, `~/` home-relative paths, or paths relative to the project root. The `skills.urls` key accepts URLs pointing to remote `SKILL.md` files that are fetched on demand.

### Global Skills (User-Level)

Global skills are located in the `.kilocode` directory within your Home directory.

- Mac and Linux: `~/.kilocode/skills/`
- Windows: `\Users\<yourUser>\.kilocode\`

```
~/.kilocode/
├── skills/                    # Generic skills (all modes)
│   ├── my-skill/
│   │   └── SKILL.md
│   └── another-skill/
│       └── SKILL.md
├── skills-code/              # Code mode only
│   └── refactoring/
│       └── SKILL.md
└── skills-architect/         # Architect mode only
    └── system-design/
        └── SKILL.md
```

### Project Skills (Workspace-Level)

Located in `.kilocode/skills/` within your project:

```
your-project/
└── .kilocode/
    ├── skills/               # Generic skills for this project
    │   └── project-conventions/
    │       └── SKILL.md
    └── skills-code/          # Code mode skills for this project
        └── linting-rules/
            └── SKILL.md
```

{% /tab %}
{% /tabs %}

## Mode-Specific Skills

{% tabs %}
{% tab label="VSCode" %}

The new platform does not use mode-specific skill directories. All skills are loaded into a shared pool and the agent decides which skill to invoke based on the skill's `description` field and the current task context.

If you need a skill to only apply in certain situations, write a clear and specific `description` in the SKILL.md frontmatter so the agent knows when to use it.

{% /tab %}
{% tab label="CLI" %}

{% /tab %}
{% tab label="VSCode (Legacy)" %}

To create a skill that only appears in a specific mode, place it in a `skills-{mode-slug}` directory:

```bash
# For Code mode only
mkdir -p ~/.kilocode/skills-code/typescript-patterns

# For Architect mode only
mkdir -p ~/.kilocode/skills-architect/microservices
```

The directory naming pattern is `skills-{mode-slug}` where `{mode-slug}` matches the mode's identifier (e.g., `code`, `architect`, `ask`, `debug`).

{% /tab %}
{% /tabs %}

## Priority and Overrides

{% tabs %}
{% tab label="VSCode" %}

When multiple skills share the same name, project-level skills (`.kilo/skills/`) take precedence over global skills (`~/.kilo/skills/`). Skills from compatibility directories (`.claude/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`) and additional configured paths are loaded alongside project and global skills.

{% /tab %}
{% tab label="CLI" %}

When multiple skills share the same name, project-level skills (`.kilo/skills/`) take precedence over global skills (`~/.kilo/skills/`). Skills from compatibility directories (`.claude/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`) and additional configured paths are loaded alongside project and global skills.

{% /tab %}
{% tab label="VSCode (Legacy)" %}

When multiple skills share the same name, Kilo Code uses these priority rules:

1. **Project skills override global skills** - A project skill with the same name takes precedence
2. **Mode-specific skills override generic skills** - A skill in `skills-code/` overrides the same skill in `skills/` when in Code mode

This allows you to:

- Define global skills for personal use
- Override them per-project when needed
- Customize behavior for specific modes

{% /tab %}
{% /tabs %}

## When Skills Are Loaded

{% tabs %}
{% tab label="VSCode" %}

Skills are discovered when a session starts. The CLI scans all configured skill directories and reads metadata (name, description, file path) for each skill.

- In the **CLI**: Skills are loaded when you start a new session or run `kilo run`
- In the **VS Code extension**: Skills are loaded when the extension connects to the CLI server

Skills are re-scanned at the start of each new session. To pick up newly added or modified skills, start a new session.

{% /tab %}
{% tab label="VSCode (Legacy)" %}

Skills are discovered when Kilo Code initializes:

- When VSCode starts
- When you reload the VSCode window (`Cmd+Shift+P` → "Developer: Reload Window")

Skills directories are monitored for changes to `SKILL.md` files. However, the most reliable way to pick up new skills is to reload VS or the Kilo Code extension.

**Adding or modifying skills requires reloading VSCode for changes to take effect.**

## Using Symlinks

You can symlink skills directories to share skills across machines or from a central repository. When using symlinks, the skill's `name` field must match the **symlink name**, not the target directory name.

{% /tab %}
{% /tabs %}

## SKILL.md Format

The `SKILL.md` file uses YAML frontmatter followed by Markdown content containing the instructions:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill-name
description: A brief description of what this skill does and when to use it
---

# Instructions

Your detailed instructions for the AI agent go here.

The agent will read this content when it decides to use the skill based on
your request matching the description above.

## Example Usage

You can include examples, guidelines, code snippets, etc.
```

### Frontmatter Fields

Per the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification):

| Field           | Required | Description                                                                                           |
| --------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`          | Yes      | Max 64 characters. Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only. Must not start or end with a hyphen. |
| `description`   | Yes      | Max 1024 characters. Describes what the skill does and when to use it.                                |
| `license`       | No       | License name or reference to a bundled license file                                                   |
| `compatibility` | No       | Environment requirements (intended product, system packages, network access, etc.)                    |
| `metadata`      | No       | Arbitrary key-value mapping for additional metadata                                                   |

### Example with Optional Fields

```markdown
---
name: pdf-processing
description: Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents.
license: Apache-2.0
metadata:
  author: example-org
  version: 1.0.0
---

## How to extract text

1. Use pdfplumber for text extraction...

## How to fill forms

...
```

### Name Matching Rule

In Kilo Code, the `name` field **must match** the parent directory name:

```
✅ Correct:
skills/
└── frontend-design/
    └── SKILL.md  # name: frontend-design

❌ Incorrect:
skills/
└── frontend-design/
    └── SKILL.md  # name: my-frontend-skill  (doesn't match!)
```

## Optional Bundled Resources

While `SKILL.md` is the only required file, you can optionally include additional directories to support your skill:

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md           # Required: instructions + metadata
├── scripts/           # Optional: executable code
├── references/        # Optional: documentation
└── assets/            # Optional: templates, resources
```

These additional files can be referenced from your skill's instructions, allowing the agent to read documentation, execute scripts, or use templates as needed.

## Example: Creating a Skill

{% tabs %}
{% tab label="VSCode" %}

1. Create the skill directory:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.kilo/skills/api-design
   ```

2. Create `SKILL.md` (see content below)

3. Start a new session to pick up the skill

{% /tab %}
{% tab label="CLI" %}

1. Create the skill directory:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.kilo/skills/api-design
   ```

2. Create `SKILL.md` (see content below)

3. Start a new session to pick up the skill

{% /tab %}
{% tab label="VSCode (Legacy)" %}

1. Create the skill directory:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.kilocode/skills/api-design
   ```

2. Create `SKILL.md` (see content below)

3. Reload VSCode to load the skill

4. The skill will now be available in all modes

{% /tab %}
{% /tabs %}

Example `SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: api-design
description: REST API design best practices and conventions
---

# API Design Guidelines

When designing REST APIs, follow these conventions:

## URL Structure

- Use plural nouns for resources: `/users`, `/orders`
- Use kebab-case for multi-word resources: `/order-items`
- Nest related resources: `/users/{id}/orders`

## HTTP Methods

- GET: Retrieve resources
- POST: Create new resources
- PUT: Replace entire resource
- PATCH: Partial update
- DELETE: Remove resource

## Response Codes

- 200: Success
- 201: Created
- 400: Bad Request
- 404: Not Found
- 500: Server Error
```

## Troubleshooting

### Skill Not Loading?

{% tabs %}
{% tab label="VSCode" %}

1. **Verify frontmatter**: Ensure `name` and `description` are present in the YAML frontmatter. The `name` does not need to match the directory name but should be unique across all loaded skills.

2. **Start a new session**: Skills are scanned at session start. Begin a new session to pick up changes.

3. **Check file location**: Ensure `SKILL.md` is directly inside the skill directory (e.g., `.kilo/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md`), not nested further.

4. **Check config paths**: If using `skills.paths` or `skills.urls`, verify the paths and URLs are correct in your `kilo.jsonc`.

{% /tab %}
{% tab label="VSCode (Legacy)" %}

1. **Check the Output panel**: Open `View` → `Output` → Select "Kilo Code" from dropdown. Look for skill-related errors.

2. **Verify frontmatter**: Ensure `name` exactly matches the directory name and `description` is present.

3. **Reload VSCode**: Skills are loaded at startup. Use `Cmd+Shift+P` → "Developer: Reload Window".

4. **Check file location**: Ensure `SKILL.md` is directly inside the skill directory, not nested further.

{% /tab %}
{% /tabs %}

### Verifying a Skill is Available

To confirm a skill is properly loaded and available to the agent, you can ask the agent directly. Simply send a message like:

- "Do you have access to skill X?"
- "Is the skill called X loaded?"
- "What skills do you have available?"

The agent will respond with information about whether the skill is loaded and accessible. This is the most reliable way to verify that a skill is available after adding it or reloading VSCode.

If the agent confirms the skill is available, you're ready to use it. If not, check the troubleshooting steps above to identify and resolve the issue.

### Checking if a Skill Was Used

{% tabs %}
{% tab label="VSCode" %}

When the agent uses a skill, it invokes the `skill` tool with the skill's name. Look for a `skill` tool call in the conversation to confirm a skill was loaded. The tool output includes the full skill content injected into context.

{% /tab %}
{% tab label="VSCode (Legacy)" %}

To see if a skill was actually used during a conversation, look for a `read_file` tool call in the chat that targets a `SKILL.md` file. When the agent decides to use a skill, it reads the full skill file into context—this appears as a file read operation in the conversation.

There's currently no dedicated UI indicator showing "Skill X was activated." The `read_file` call is the most reliable way to confirm a skill was used.

### Common Errors

| Error                           | Cause                                        | Solution                                         |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| "missing required 'name' field" | No `name` in frontmatter                     | Add `name: your-skill-name`                      |
| "name doesn't match directory"  | Mismatch between frontmatter and folder name | Make `name` match exactly                        |
| Skill not appearing             | Wrong directory structure                    | Verify path follows `skills/skill-name/SKILL.md` |
