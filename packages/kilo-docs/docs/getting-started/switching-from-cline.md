# Migrating from Cline to Kilo

A practical guide for developers switching from Cline to Kilo.

## Why Switch?

**Speed.** The Kilo Platform is designed to reduce friction across the entire development workflow. Beyond feature parity with Cline, Kilo includes Code Reviews, App Builder, Cloud Agents, and one-click Deploy.

**Multi-platform.** Work in VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, CLI, or the web. Your Sessions sync across all of them automatically.

**Specialized modes.** Instead of one agent doing everything, Kilo has five specialized modes optimized for different parts of your workflow.

**500+ models.** More providers, more options, better pricing flexibility. Switch models mid-conversation if you want.

## Understanding Kilo's Mode System

Cline uses a single agent with a Plan/Act toggle. Kilo takes a different approach: five specialized modes, each optimized for a specific part of development. You select modes from a dropdown in the interface in the Kilo Extension, or with slash commands in the CLI.

### Kilo's Five Modes

#### Code Mode (default)

- **What it does:** Implementation and refactoring
- **Cline equivalent:** Act mode
- **When to use:** Writing features, fixing bugs, making changes
- **Example:** "Add user authentication to the API"

#### Ask Mode

- **What it does:** Answers questions, explains code
- **Cline equivalent:** Plan mode (read-only exploration)
- **When to use:** Understanding codebases, learning patterns
- **Example:** "How does our caching layer work?"

#### Debug Mode

- **What it does:** Systematic troubleshooting and error diagnosis
- **Cline equivalent:** Act mode focused on debugging
- **When to use:** Tracking down bugs, fixing runtime issues
- **Example:** "Why is this API endpoint returning 500?"

#### Architect Mode

- **What it does:** Planning, design, and technical leadership
- **Cline equivalent:** Plan mode (exploration and planning)
- **When to use:** Before complex refactors, designing new systems
- **Example:** "Design a caching strategy for our API"

#### Orchestrator Mode

- **What it does:** Breaks down complex tasks, coordinates other modes
- **Cline equivalent:** Complex multi-step workflows
- **When to use:** Large features spanning multiple systems
- **Example:** "Build a complete user management system"

### Mode Switching in Action

**Cline workflow:** Toggle Plan/Act → Submit task → Plan phase → Approve → Act phase → Checkpoint

**Kilo workflow:**  
Select mode from dropdown → Build → Switch modes as needed → Checkpoint → Session auto-saves

Or

Select Orchestrator mode → autonomously define subtasks → intelligently distribute subtasks across modes

#### Example: Refactoring authentication

**Cline:**

1. Enable Plan/Act mode
2. "Refactor auth to use OAuth2"
3. Wait for plan → Review → Approve
4. Watch step-by-step execution
5. Checkpoint when done

**Kilo:**

1. Select **Orchestrator** from the mode dropdown
2. "Implement OAuth2 refactor for our authentication"
3. Orchestrator creates subtasks for other modes automatically
4. **Architect Mode** reviews the architecture
5. **Code Mode** implements the OAuth2 client
6. Session/checkpoints preserved automatically

#### Example: Understanding unfamiliar code

**Cline:** Use Plan mode (but risk accidentally switching to Act)

**Kilo:** Select **Ask** from the dropdown

- "Explain how the payment processing flow works"
- "What external services does this integrate with?"
- Ask mode never writes files, so exploration is always safe

**Why this matters:** In Cline, you might accidentally make changes while exploring. In Kilo, Ask and Architect modes can't write files, so you're safe to explore without worry. Kilo's **Orchestrator** mode lets you intelligently generate and execute subtasks that are optimized for each mode.

## Beyond the IDE: Kilo's Platform Features

One of the biggest differences from Cline is that Kilo isn't just an IDE extension. It's a platform with multiple interfaces that can all share your Sessions and context.

### Cloud Agents

Run Kilo from [app.kilo.ai/cloud](https://app.kilo.ai/cloud) without needing your local machine. Great for:

- Working from a tablet or phone
- Offloading heavy tasks
- Parallel execution without blocking your IDE

### Parallel Agents

Run multiple agents simultaneously without conflicts, in both the IDE and CLI. Start an agent working on tests while another handles documentation.

### Sessions

Your conversation history, context, and state sync across all interfaces automatically. Start a task in the CLI, continue in VS Code, check progress on mobile.

### App Builder

Build live apps and sites directly from the web with a real-time preview. Similar to Lovable, but integrated with your Kilo Sessions. Deploy with one click when you're ready.

### Kilo Deploy

One-click deployments from directly within Kilo. Go from code to production without leaving your workflow.

### Code Reviews

Automatically analyzes your PRs using your choice of AI model. Reviews happen the moment a PR is opened or updated, covering performance, security, style, and test coverage.

### Managed Indexing

Semantic search across your repositories using cloud-hosted embeddings. Kilo indexes your codebase to deliver more relevant, context-aware responses.

### Autocomplete

In-line ghost-text completions with tab to complete. Works alongside the agent modes for a complete coding experience.

## Complete Development Workflows

### New Feature Development

**Kilo approach:**

1. **Architect mode:** "Design a user notification system"
2. Review architecture, discuss trade-offs
3. **Code mode:** "Implement the notification service"
4. Fast Apply builds it quickly
5. **Debug mode:** "Email sends aren't working"
6. Fix issues
7. Session auto-saves as "Notifications-Complete"

### Debugging Production Issues

**Kilo approach:**

1. **Debug mode:** "Checkout fails with 'payment_intent_not_found'"
2. Debug mode systematically checks logs, traces API calls
3. **Code mode:** "Add idempotency key to prevent duplicates"
4. Verify fix

### Large Refactoring

**Kilo approach:**

1. **Ask mode:** "Explain our current auth implementation"
2. **Architect mode:** "Design migration to JWT tokens"
3. Session saves as "Auth-Refactor-Plan"
4. **Code mode:** Implement JWT generation, update middleware
5. **Debug mode:** Fix failing tests

### Learning Unfamiliar Code

**Kilo approach:**

1. **Ask mode:** "Explain how payment processing works"
2. "What happens when a payment fails?"
3. "Show me the retry logic"
4. Ask mode never writes, so exploration is completely safe
5. When ready, switch to **Code mode** to make changes

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I have to switch modes constantly?** No. Orchestrator does that automatically. Code mode handles most day-to-day work. Switch when you need specialized behavior.

**Q: What if I forget to switch modes?** Code mode is the default and handles most tasks. It'll still work, just might not be optimized for exploration or planning.

**Q: Can I customize what each mode does?** Yes. Add mode-specific instructions in settings, or create custom modes.

**Q: Can I use both Cline and Kilo side-by-side?** Yes. They're separate extensions.

**Q: What's the difference between Cloud Agents and the IDE extension?** Same capabilities, different interface. Cloud Agents run in the browser, so you can work from any device without your local machine.
