# AGENTS.md

Kilo CLI is an open source AI coding agent that generates code from natural language, automates tasks, and supports 500+ AI models.

- ALWAYS USE PARALLEL TOOLS WHEN APPLICABLE.
- The default branch in this repo is `main`.
- Prefer automation: execute requested actions without confirmation unless blocked by missing info or safety/irreversibility.
- You may be running in a git worktree. All changes must be made in your current working directory — never modify files in the main repo checkout.

## Build and Dev

- **Dev**: `bun run dev` (runs from root) or `bun run --cwd packages/opencode --conditions=browser src/index.ts`
- **Dev with params**: `bun dev -- help`
- **Extension**: `bun run extension` (build + launch VS Code with the extension in dev mode). Pass `--no-build` to skip the build.
- **Typecheck**: `bun turbo typecheck` (uses `tsgo`, not `tsc`)
- **Test**: `bun test` from `packages/opencode/` (NOT from root -- root blocks tests)
- **Single test**: `bun test test/tool/tool.test.ts` from `packages/opencode/`
- **SDK regen**: After changing server endpoints in `packages/opencode/src/server/`, run `./script/generate.ts` from root to regenerate `packages/sdk/js/`
- **Knip** (unused exports): `bun run knip` from `packages/kilo-vscode/`. CI runs this — all exported types/functions must be imported somewhere. Remove or unexport unused exports before pushing.
- **Source links**: After adding or changing URLs in `packages/kilo-vscode/`, `packages/kilo-vscode/webview-ui/`, or `packages/opencode/src/`, run `bun run script/extract-source-links.ts` from the repo root and commit the updated `packages/kilo-docs/source-links.md`. CI runs this check — the build fails if the file is stale.
- **kilocode_change check**: `bun run check-kilocode-change` from `packages/kilo-vscode/`. CI runs this — `kilocode_change` is a marker for upstream merge conflicts and must not appear in `packages/kilo-vscode/` or `packages/kilo-ui/` (these are entirely Kilo Code additions). Remove the markers before pushing.
- **opencode annotation check**: `bun run script/check-opencode-annotations.ts` from repo root. CI runs this on PRs touching `packages/opencode/` — every Kilo-specific change in shared opencode files must be annotated with `kilocode_change` markers. Exempt paths (no markers needed): `packages/opencode/src/kilocode/`, `packages/opencode/test/kilocode/`, and any path containing `kilocode` in the name.
- **Backend/SDK programmatic testing**: see [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md) for spawning the local main-branch backend (`bun dev serve`) and driving it via `curl` — use this instead of `kilo serve` (prod binary) when testing backend fixes.

## Products

All products are clients of the **CLI** (`packages/opencode/`), which contains the AI agent runtime, HTTP server, and session management. Each client spawns or connects to a `kilo serve` process and communicates via HTTP + SSE using `@kilocode/sdk`.

| Product                | Package                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Kilo CLI               | `packages/opencode/`    | Core engine. TUI, `kilo run`, `kilo serve`, `kilo web`. Fork of upstream OpenCode.                                                                                                   |
| Kilo VS Code Extension | `packages/kilo-vscode/` | VS Code extension. Bundles the CLI binary, spawns `kilo serve` as a child process. Includes the **Agent Manager** — a multi-session orchestration panel with git worktree isolation. |
| OpenCode Desktop       | `packages/desktop/`     | Standalone Tauri native app. Bundles CLI as sidecar. Single-session UI. Unrelated to the VS Code extension. Not actively maintained — synced from upstream fork.                     |
| OpenCode Web           | `packages/app/`         | Shared SolidJS frontend used by both the desktop app and `kilo web` CLI command. Not actively maintained — synced from upstream fork.                                                |

**Agent Manager** refers to a feature inside `packages/kilo-vscode/` (extension code in `src/agent-manager/`, webview in `webview-ui/agent-manager/`). It is not a standalone product. See the extension's `AGENTS.md` for details.

## Monorepo Structure

Turborepo + Bun workspaces. The packages you'll work with most:

| Package                    | Name                       | Purpose                                                                                    |

| `packages/desktop/`        | `@opencode-ai/desktop`     | Tauri desktop app shell                                                                    |
| `packages/util/`           | `@opencode-ai/util`        | Shared utilities (error, path, retry, slug, etc.)                                          |

## Style Guide

- Keep things in one function unless composable or reusable
- Avoid unnecessary destructuring. Instead of `const { a, b } = obj`, use `obj.a` and `obj.b` to preserve context
- Avoid `try`/`catch` where possible
- Avoid using the `any` type
- Prefer single word variable names where possible
- Use Bun APIs when possible, like `Bun.file()`
- Rely on type inference when possible; avoid explicit type annotations or interfaces unless necessary for exports or clarity

### Avoid let statements

We don't like `let` statements, especially combined with if/else statements.
Prefer `const`.

Good:

### Naming Enforcement (Read This)

THIS RULE IS MANDATORY FOR AGENT WRITTEN CODE.

- Use single word names by default for new locals, params, and helper functions.
- Multi-word names are allowed only when a single word would be unclear or ambiguous.
- Do not introduce new camelCase compounds when a short single-word alternative is clear.
- Before finishing edits, review touched lines and shorten newly introduced identifiers where possible.
- Good short names to prefer: `pid`, `cfg`, `err`, `opts`, `dir`, `root`, `child`, `state`, `timeout`.
- Examples to avoid unless truly required: `inputPID`, `existingClient`, `connectTimeout`, `workerPath`.

```ts
const foo = condition ? 1 : 2
```

Bad:

```ts
let foo

if (condition) foo = 1
else foo = 2
```

### Avoid else statements

Prefer early returns or using an `iife` to avoid else statements.

Good:

```ts
function foo() {
  if (condition) return 1
  return 2
}
```

Bad:

```ts
function foo() {
  if (condition) return 1
  else return 2
}
```

### No empty catch blocks

Never leave a `catch` block empty. An empty `catch` silently swallows errors and hides bugs. If you're tempted to write one, ask yourself:

1. Is the `try`/`catch` even needed? (prefer removing it)
2. Should the error be handled explicitly? (recover, retry, rethrow)
3. At minimum, log it so failures are visible

Good:

```ts
try {
  await save(data)
} catch (err) {
  log.error("save failed", { err })
}
```

Bad:

```ts
try {
  await save(data)
} catch {}
```

### Prefer single word naming

Try your best to find a single word name for your variables, functions, etc.
Only use multiple words if you cannot.

Good:

```ts
const foo = 1
const bar = 2
const baz = 3
```

Bad:

```ts
const fooBar = 1
const barBaz = 2
const bazFoo = 3
```

## Testing

You MUST avoid using `mocks` as much as possible.
Tests MUST test actual implementation, do not duplicate logic into a test.

## Commit Conventions

[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) with scopes matching packages: `vscode`, `cli`, `agent-manager`, `sdk`, `ui`, `i18n`, `kilo-docs`, `gateway`, `telemetry`, `desktop`. Omit scope when spanning multiple packages.

## Changesets

User-facing changes (features, fixes, breaking changes) require a changeset file for release notes. Run `bunx changeset add` or manually create `.changeset/<slug>.md`. Use `patch` for bug fixes, `minor` for new features, `major` for breaking changes. See `.changeset/README.md` for details.

Changeset descriptions appear directly in release notes and are read by end users. Keep them concise and feature-oriented — describe **what changed from the user's perspective**, not implementation details. Write in imperative mood (e.g. "Support exporting conversations as markdown" not "Add a new export handler that serializes session messages to .md files").

## Pull Requests

PR descriptions should be 2-3 lines covering **what** changed and **why**. Focus on intent and context a reviewer can't get from the diff — skip file-by-file inventories, test result summaries, and anything obvious from the code itself.

## GitHub Issues

- When creating a GitHub issue for the VS Code extension or JetBrains plugin, use the repo's existing issue templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`. Pick the matching template (`Bug report`, `Feature Request`, or `Question`) instead of opening a blank issue.
- Do not add platform-specific title prefixes such as `[JetBrains]`, `[Jetbrains]`, `[JB]`, `[VS Code]`, `[VSCode]`, or similar. Use a plain, descriptive title.
- Always add VS Code extension issues to the GitHub project `VS Code Extension`: https://github.com/orgs/Kilo-Org/projects/25
- Always add JetBrains plugin issues to the GitHub project `Jetbrains Plugin`: https://github.com/orgs/Kilo-Org/projects/39
- When using `gh`, prefer `gh issue create --template "..." --project "..."` with the matching project title.
- If project assignment fails because `gh` is missing the required scope, run `gh auth refresh -s project` and retry.

## Fork Merge Process

Kilo CLI is a fork of [opencode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode).

**Very important**: when planning or coding, update shared files with OpenCode as last resort! Everything is shared code from OpenCode, except folders that contain `kilo` in the name or have a parent directory that contains `kilo` in the name. Example of kilo specific folders: `packages/opencode/src/kilocode/` and `packages/kilo-docs/`. Always look for ways to implement your feature or fix in a way that minimizes changes to shared code.

### Minimizing Merge Conflicts

We regularly merge upstream changes from opencode. To minimize merge conflicts and keep the sync process smooth:

1. **Prefer `kilocode` directories** - Place Kilo-specific code in dedicated directories whenever possible:
   - `packages/opencode/src/kilocode/` - Kilo-specific source code
   - `packages/opencode/test/kilocode/` - Kilo-specific tests
   - `packages/kilo-gateway/` - The Kilo Gateway package

2. **Minimize changes to shared files** - When you must modify files that exist in upstream opencode, keep changes as small and isolated as possible.

3. **Use `kilocode_change` markers** - When modifying shared code, mark your changes with `kilocode_change` comments so they can be easily identified during merges.
   Do not use these markers in files within directories with kilo in the name

4. **Avoid restructuring upstream code** - Don't refactor or reorganize code that comes from opencode unless absolutely necessary.

5. **Mirror new config keys to the cloud schema** - When adding a `kilocode_change` key to `Config.Info` in `packages/opencode/src/config/config.ts`, also add the matching JSON Schema entry in `apps/web/src/app/config.json/extras.ts` in the [cloud repo](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/cloud). See [CLI Config Schema](packages/kilo-docs/pages/contributing/architecture/config-schema.md) for the step-by-step.

The goal is to keep our diff from upstream as small as possible, making regular merges straightforward and reducing the risk of conflicts.

### Kilocode Change Markers

To minimize merge conflicts when syncing with upstream, mark Kilo Code-specific changes in shared code with `kilocode_change` comments.

**Single line:**

```typescript
const value = 42 // kilocode_change
```

**Multi-line:**

```typescript
// kilocode_change start
const foo = 1
const bar = 2
// kilocode_change end
```

**New files:**

```typescript
// kilocode_change - new file
```

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
**JSX/TSX (inside JSX templates):**

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```tsx
{/* kilocode_change */}
```

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```tsx
{/* kilocode_change start */}
<MyComponent />
{/* kilocode_change end */}
```

#### When markers are NOT needed

Code in these paths is Kilo Code-specific and does NOT need `kilocode_change` markers:

- `packages/opencode/src/kilocode/` - All files in this directory
- `packages/opencode/test/kilocode/` - All test files for kilocode
- Any other path containing `kilocode` in filename or directory name

These paths are entirely Kilo Code additions and won't conflict with upstream.
